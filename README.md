# Webpage Content Extractor

**Webpage Content Extractor** is a Python tool that downloads a webpage, extracts its HTML, JavaScript, and CSS content, and saves them into separate files. The tool also provides size information for each content type and organizes the files into a subfolder based on the webpage's domain name.

## Features:
- Downloads a webpage and saves the raw HTML.
- Extracts and saves the following components:
  - HTML (without `<style>` and `<script>` tags)
  - JavaScript (from `<script>` tags)
  - CSS (from `<style>` tags)
- Organizes the extracted content into a subfolder named after the webpage's domain.
- Outputs a summary of file sizes, including the total size.

## Using a Virtual Environment

To ensure that dependencies are managed separately and to avoid conflicts, it is recommended to run this tool within a virtual environment.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
3. Run the script and provide a webpage URL when prompted.

Example:

```bash
python webpage_content_splitter.py
```

4. The HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files will be saved in a subfolder based on the webpageâ€™s domain name.

## Requirements:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

## Example:

```bash
python webpage_content_splitter.py
```

Enter the URL of the web page: `https://example.com`
